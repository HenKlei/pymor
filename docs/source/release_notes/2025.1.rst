Main new features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Purely data-based neural network reductors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In `[#2295] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2295>`_,
the :class:`~pymor.reductors.neural_network.NeuralNetworkReductor` was adjusted such that
it is now possible to use it also without a full order model at hand. It can be run
completely data-driven only with parameter values and snapshot data. Moreover, a precomputed
reduced basis can be passed as an input to the constructor of the reductor.



Backward incompatible changes
